To compare the hashes of files across the two Debian hosts, you can follow these detailed steps:

---

### Step 1: **Generate Hashes**
1. **Generate SHA256 Hashes** for all files on both hosts:
   - Host A:
     ```bash
     sudo find / -type f -exec sha256sum {} + | sort > /tmp/host_a_hashes.txt
     ```
   - Host B:
     ```bash
     sudo find / -type f -exec sha256sum {} + | sort > /tmp/host_b_hashes.txt
     ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `find / -type f`: Finds all files.
   - `-exec sha256sum {}`: Computes SHA256 hash for each file.
   - `| sort`: Ensures the output is sorted for easy comparison.

2. **Exclude Specific Directories**:
   To skip directories like `/proc`, `/dev`, and `/sys`, modify `find`:
   ```bash
   sudo find / \( -path /proc -o -path /dev -o -path /sys \) -prune -o -type f -exec sha256sum {} + | sort > /tmp/host_hashes.txt
   ```

---

### Step 2: **Transfer Hash Files**
Transfer the hash files to a central comparison machine:
```bash
scp /tmp/host_a_hashes.txt user@comparison_host:/path/to/compare
scp /tmp/host_b_hashes.txt user@comparison_host:/path/to/compare
```

---

### Step 3: **Compare Hashes**
On the comparison machine:
1. **Use `comm` to Find Differences**:
   ```bash
   comm -3 /path/to/compare/host_a_hashes.txt /path/to/compare/host_b_hashes.txt > hash_differences.txt
   ```

   - `comm -3`: Shows lines unique to each file.
   - Each line will include the SHA256 hash and the file path.

2. **Optional: Filter Specific Differences**:
   If you only need files that exist on both systems but have different hashes:
   ```bash
   awk '{print $2}' host_a_hashes.txt > host_a_paths.txt
   awk '{print $2}' host_b_hashes.txt > host_b_paths.txt
   comm -12 host_a_paths.txt host_b_paths.txt > common_files.txt

   grep -F -f common_files.txt host_a_hashes.txt > filtered_host_a_hashes.txt
   grep -F -f common_files.txt host_b_hashes.txt > filtered_host_b_hashes.txt

   diff filtered_host_a_hashes.txt filtered_host_b_hashes.txt > differing_hashes.txt
   ```

---

### Step 4: **Analyze Results**
1. **View the Differences**:
   Review `hash_differences.txt` or `differing_hashes.txt`:
   - Files listed with different hashes have differing content.
   - Files missing on one host will only appear in one list.

2. **Detailed Analysis**:
   For specific files:
   ```bash
   diff /path/on/host_a/file /path/on/host_b/file
   ```

---

### Step 5: **Automate the Process**
Create a script for repeated comparisons:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

HOST=$1
OUTPUT=$2

# Generate hashes
sudo find / \( -path /proc -o -path /dev -o -path /sys \) -prune -o -type f -exec sha256sum {} + | sort > /tmp/"${HOST}_hashes.txt"

# Transfer to comparison host
scp /tmp/"${HOST}_hashes.txt" user@comparison_host:/path/to/compare

# Compare
ssh user@comparison_host "comm -3 /path/to/compare/host_a_hashes.txt /path/to/compare/host_b_hashes.txt > /path/to/compare/hash_differences.txt"

echo "Hash comparison complete. Results saved to ${OUTPUT}."
```

---

### Step 6: **Advanced Tools for Deeper Comparison**
1. **Use `rsync` for On-the-Fly Comparison**:
   ```bash
   rsync -rcn --checksum --out-format='%n' root@host_a:/ root@host_b:/ > rsync_differences.txt
   ```

2. **Visualize Differences with `diffoscope`**:
   ```bash
   diffoscope /comparison_dir/host_a /comparison_dir/host_b > detailed_hash_diff.txt
   ```
